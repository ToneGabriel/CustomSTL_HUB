# CustomSTL_HUB

This repository serves as a **central entry point** for my custom **Standard Template Library** implementations in **C** and **C++**.  
It provides equivalent functionality for common data structures and algorithms, making it easier to learn, compare, and explore **STL** concepts in both modern **C++** and pure **C** environments.    

Both projects are separate and have their own detailed documentation.  
This hub exists so you can access them easily from a single link.
